# Cloff UI 

## Overview

Cloff UI is a modern, open source component library built with a focus on micro-interactions, clean design, and developer experience. 

It is designed to help you build delightful user interfaces faster, with components that are easy to customize, and ready for production. 

We're building Cloff UI as a community driven project, and we welcome all kinds of contribution, from bug fixes to documentation improvement. 

If you're passionate about design systems and interactive user experiences, we'd love to have you contribute and grow with us!
